# Topsis WebApp

This repository contains the code for a web application that implements the Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The application is built using the Streamlit framework for Python and allows users to input multiple alternatives and criteria, and then calculates the relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution based on the TOPSIS method.

## Demo

A demo of the application is available at [topsis.streamlit.app](https://topsis.streamlit.app). You can use the demo to see how the application works and how you can use it to perform multi-criteria decision analysis.

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter the alternatives and criteria that you want to evaluate, and then click the "Calculate" button. The application will then calculate the relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution and display the results in a table.

## Diagram of the TOPSIS Process

The TOPSIS method consists of several steps, which are summarized in the diagram below:

1. Define the decision problem and the decision criteria.
2. Normalize the decision matrix to account for the different units of measurement.
3. Determine the weights for each criterion based on their relative importance.
4. Calculate the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution.
5. Calculate the relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution.
6. Rank the alternatives based on their relative closeness to the ideal solution.
